#Machine Learning Pipeline
The goal of this project is to developee a comprehensive toolkit/Python package on machine learning. 
This toolkit normalizes the machine learning process into six steps: 

1) Getting Data

2) Exploring Data

3) Imputing Data

4) Generating Features

5) Running Models

6) Evaluating Models

To use this package in Python:

1) Clone the repository into your computer 

2) Set up local path (import os, os.chdir("local path"))

3) From mlpipe import *

4) Call functions based on your (get.*; exp.*; imp.*;
